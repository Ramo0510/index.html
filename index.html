       <h2>Healthy Eating</h2>
       <p>The best way to ensure you re eating healthily is to eat a wide variety of different kinds of food.
         Have vegetables, salad or fruit with every meal – they are packed with vitamins, minerals and fibre 
         that are good for your health, help you feel full, and protect you from chronic diseases. Eat a variety
          of colours for the best mix of protective nutrients. At least five servings of vegetables, salad and 
          fruit is recommended for a healthy diet.
          Cereals, rice, pasta, potatoes and breads are great sources of energy. It’s best to eat wholegrain 
          versions of these as they contain fibre to keep your digestive system working well. How much you 
          need depends on your age, size, gender and activity levels.
